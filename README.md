Simple Python Script to change the Gnome Desktop Background to a random Adventure Time Title slide.
This is a work in progress.

**How to Use**

Note that pointing to a hardcoded folder is (obviously) not the ideal method but what currently works in testing.
- Put the script in the ~/Pictures/ folder
- Extract the Split ZIP of Wallpapers to ~/Pictures/at4w
- Run the script using python3

**Upcoming Changes**
- Remake this in a way that's scalable
- Create versions for other Desktop Enviornments
