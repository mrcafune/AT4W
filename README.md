**Adventure Time 4 Wallpaper**

Simple Python Script to change the Gnome Desktop Background to a random Adventure Time Title slide.
This is a work in progress.

**How to Use**
Note that pointing to a hardcoded folder is (obviously) not the ideal method but what currently works in testing.
- Put the script & folder in the ~/Pictures/ folder
- Run the script using python3

**Upcoming Changes**
- Remake this in a way that's scalable
- Create versions for other Desktop Enviornments
